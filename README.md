This is our BE project named "Conversion of sign language to text using mediapipe and lstm"

## Introduction

Sign languages are languages that uses the visual-manual modality to express meaning, instead of just spoken words. It means of communication through bodily movements, especially of the hands and arms, when spoken communication is impossible or not desirable. Sign Language is the methods of communication of deaf and dumb people all over the world. Sign Language to Text Conversion System is a benefit for helping deaf and dumb persons to communicate with others. The paper proposes a method for an application which would help to convert the Sign language into the text format. With the help of neural networks and computer vision we can detect hand gestures and give the respective output. We have come up with a system which uses several methods such as using Media Pipe Holistic
model, collect Key point values for training and testing, pre-processing data Create labels and features, build and train LSTM neural network.
